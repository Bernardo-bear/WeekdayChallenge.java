# Weekday Challenge 🗓️

This is a simple Java program that uses conditional structures (`if`, `else if`, `else`) to identify the number corresponding to a day of the week based on user input.

## 💻 How It Works

The program asks the user to enter a day of the week (in **English**) and returns a number from 1 to 7 according to the table below:

| Day        | Number |
|------------|--------|
| Sunday     | 1      |
| Monday     | 2      |
| Tuesday    | 3      |
| Wednesday  | 4      |
| Thursday   | 5      |
| Friday     | 6      |
| Saturday   | 7      |

If the input is invalid or not recognized as a weekday, the program returns an error message.
